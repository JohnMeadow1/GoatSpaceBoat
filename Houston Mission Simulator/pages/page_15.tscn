text = "Reducing Expenses - someone will lose his job, but now you need to use this procedure:
0. Execute points starting from point 1. After every point check if expenses still need to be reduced.
1. Unfreeze all animals - they are not so important as money.
2. Change fuel mixture - Helium-3 is expensive, change proportion in the mixture to save on Helium-3. An access panel is placed in Machine Room.
3. Terminate contracts on total amount 10 000 $. These people will lose their access to oxygen, pressure and life-support systems. Protect the Politician (the highest priority)
4. Kill the crew from Houston and abort the mission. Start new projects and find new founders."
